                            <p>Introduction: Scary Movie is a fun comedy. In its first installment, the film parodies scenes from several horror films such as *I Know What You Did Last Summer* and *Scream*, but instead of the terrifying scenes of the original versions, the humor is present in every detail, every character, and every scene in the film, and will accompany the viewer from beginning to end. This is considered a worthy rival to *American Pie*.</p>
